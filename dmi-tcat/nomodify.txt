This is a text file which shouldn't be modified.

The creation time of this file will be read by controller.php to test whether it should run an automatic update.
Such an update will only be executed at the same time of day as this file was originally created (= installation time).
This ensures all TCAT installations world-wide will not 'git pull' and update their databases at the same time.

The philosophy behind this strategy is:

1) an accidentally pushed syntax error could be less catastrophic if detected in time
2) be nice to github
